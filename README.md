### Full-stack guidelines and recipes with examples to create offline-first, passwordless, secure, and realtime Web Applications with 'pluggable' world-wide adopted technologies.

Starting a new project while covering all necessary parts to have a `production ready` multiplatform web application has work intense and can be overwhelming. The number of different frameworks, libraries, and techniques in web development is growing by the minute. 

In this project we aim to create full-stack recipes with different chosen web technologies, all glue together, so you can start right away your project focusing on the functionalities and not on the setup.

## Boilerplates vs Recipes guidelines
Forks from other projects often lead to poor maintenance, disconnected workflows that get obsolete. Rather than copying boilerplates, it is advised to follow official guidelines for each technology.

Apart from giving main functionalities out of the box, the approaches should focus on **network reliability, being accessible to all, safe and secure, and easily discoverable**. [Read more](https://web.dev/learn/)

### Basic functionalities for each approach
All different approaches should include the next functionalities out of the box:
- Steps to recreate `development` and `production` environment
- Links to the official guidelines of each technology and best practices.
- SPA (Single Page Application) or SSR (Server side rendering)
- PWA 
- Passwordless authentification
- Authorization and roles
- Docker-compose: 
  - Local development without external dependencies
  - Production deploy scripts and `.env` files
- CI Recipes

### Good to have:
- Optimistic UI 
- Reactive / real-time / DB Subscriptions
- Full-text search
- Authorization with Passwordless authentication with an email link and federated login (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github...)
- Basic offline mode

## Learn more
Each approach requires know-how, it is fundamental to study the chosen technologies as much as possible to accelerate the development process and avoid design pitfalls.
